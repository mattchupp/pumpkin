# Pumpkin

Pumpkin is my fun project to dip my feet in to full-stack development. This is the frontend using [nextjs](http://nextjs.org) The backend is written in express connected to mongodb with a REST api to get information. The source can be found [here](https://github.com/mattchupp/expressjs-rest-api). This is a ticketing system/bug tracker. There's still a lot of work to do, but it's been fun to create.
