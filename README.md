# Pumpkin

Pumpkin is a project to get my feet wet in full stack development. This is the frontend using react. The backend is written in express connected to mongodb with a REST api to get information. The source can be found here. This is a ticketing system/bug tracker. There's still a lot of work to do, but it's been fun to create.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
